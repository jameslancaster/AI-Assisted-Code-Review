## Prerequisites

- An [Azure DevOps Account](https://dev.azure.com/)
- An [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview)

## Getting started

1. Install the AI Assisted Code Review DevOps Extension from the [Azure DevOps Marketplace]([https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/azuredevops](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JithinJojiAnchanattu.ai-assisted-code-review)).
2. Add AI Assisted Code Review Task to Your Pipeline:

   ```yaml
   trigger:
     branches:
       exclude:
         - '*'

   pr:
     branches:
       include:
         - '*'

   jobs:
   - job: CodeReview
     pool:
       vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
     steps:
     - task: AIAssistedCodeReviewTask@1
       inputs:
         api_key: $(OpenAI_ApiKey)
         ai_model: 'gpt-4' # Specify the model to use
         bugs: true
         performance: true
         best_practices: true
         file_extensions: '.js,.ts,.css,.html'
         file_excludes: 'file1.js,file2.py,secret.txt'
         additional_prompts: 'Fix variable naming, Ensure consistent indentation, Review error handling approach'
         api_url: 'https://custom-openai-api.com/v1' # Optional: Specify a custom OpenAI API URL
   ```

3. If you do not already have Build Validation configured for your branch already add [Build validation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/branch-policies?view=azure-devops&tabs=browser#build-validation) to your branch policy to trigger the code review when a Pull Request is created.

## Specifying the AI Model

The `ai_model` input allows you to specify the OpenAI model to use for code reviews. You can choose from supported models like `gpt-4`, `gpt-3.5-turbo`, or any other model supported by OpenAI or the OpenAI-compatible service. If the specified model is not officially supported, a warning will be logged, but the task will proceed.

### Example Usage

To specify the model, include the `ai_model` input in your pipeline configuration:

```yaml
inputs:
  api_key: $(OpenAI_ApiKey)
  ai_model: 'gpt-4' # Replace with the desired model
  bugs: true
  performance: true
  best_practices: true
```

### Notes:
- If the model is not in the list of officially supported models, a warning will be logged, but the task will still attempt to use the specified model.
- Ensure the model you specify is available in your OpenAI account or service.

## Custom API URL Support

The `api_url` input allows you to specify a custom URL for the OpenAI API. This is useful if you are using a proxy, a custom deployment of the OpenAI API, or an alternative API endpoint. If not provided, the default URL (`https://api.openai.com/v1`) will be used.

### Example Usage

To use a custom API URL, include the `api_url` input in your pipeline configuration:

```yaml
inputs:
  api_key: $(OpenAI_ApiKey)
  api_url: 'https://custom-openai-api.com/v1' # Replace with your custom API URL
  ai_model: 'gpt-4'
  bugs: true
  performance: true
  best_practices: true
```
